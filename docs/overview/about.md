Simulatrex is a powerful simulation framework that utilizes LLMs (Large Language Models) for creating multi-agent simulations. It is specifically designed to cater to the needs of social sciences and market research, providing a robust platform for complex simulations. Simulatrex allows for the creation of diverse agents with unique cognitive models, enabling them to interact within a defined simulation environment. This makes it an ideal tool for studying social dynamics, market trends, and other phenomena in a controlled, simulated setting.
